Tartarus
========

Tartarus (/ˈtɑːrtərəs/) - named after a prison for bad guys in Greek mythology, is an electron app using which we can lock away games, movies or any files to fight your addiction and increase productivity.

You can use this in two ways.

1. You can lock now and set the time at which it has to be unlocked.
2. You can schedule locking and unlocking.

##Setup - Installer
Coming soon. See [tartarus-builder](https://github.com/alseambusher/tartarus-builder).

##Setup - Code (dev mode)

Install node and then

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alseambusher/tartarus
cd tartarus
npm install
npm start
```

##Force open
You can force open locked content at the expense of increase in "force open count" badge :P

##Compatibility
This should be compatible with Linux, Windows and MacOS. However, I have only tested in linux.

###Todo
1. Find alternative to `pm2` to run `tartarus-process.js`. Or find a way to package `pm2` using `electron-packager`.
2. Add auto refresh for datatables without `fs.watch`.
